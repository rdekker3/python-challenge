# python-challenge
Module 3 

This code was written by me (Ryan Dekker) and contains two Python files, each analyzing a different datasets. Both python files print their results as text files, doing the following:

#Budget Data:
The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#Election Data:
The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote
